# üöó AutoRecAI - Car Recommendation System

---

This project is an **end-to-end system** for recommending cars based on an uploaded image.

It combines:
- **Object Detection** ‚Üí to identify cars in images  
- **Image Classification** ‚Üí to recognize make and model  
- **Content-Based Recommendation Engine** ‚Üí to suggest similar cars based on user-specified price range  

The system uses **Python** for model development and training, and **Rust** for high-performance model deployment via gRPC. It also provides a **UI (TBD)** for users to upload images and receive recommendations.

## üìñ Overview  

AutoRecAI provides car recommendations based on an uploaded image.  

The system detects the car in the image, classifies its make/model, and recommends similar cars using metadata based on user specified price range.

---

### üìä Data  

The dataset contains approx 60k images of different cars. The file name of each image
contains the make and model followed by other details separated by `-`. 

For example - the following file name `Acura_ILX_2013_28_16_110_15_4_70_55_179_39_FWD_5_4_4dr_Bbw` can be interpreted as

| Field           | Value | Description |
|-----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Make**        | Acura | Manufacturer |
| **Model**       | ILX   | Model Name |
| **Year**        | 2013  | Model Year |
| **MPG City**    | 28    | Miles per Gallon (City) |
| **MPG Highway** | 16    | Miles per Gallon (Highway) |
| **Horsepower**  | 110   | Engine Power (HP) |
| **Torque**      | 15    | Torque (lb-ft) |
| **Weight**      | 4     | Vehicle Weight (1000 lbs) |
| **Length**      | 70    | Length (inches) |
| **Width**       | 55    | Width (inches) |
| **Height**      | 179   | Height (inches) |
| **Wheelbase**   | 39    | Wheelbase (inches) |
| **Drive Type**  | FWD   | Front-Wheel Drive |
| **Doors**       | 5     | Number of Doors |
| **Body Style**  | 4dr   | Four-Door Sedan |
| **Color**       | Bbw   | Black/White/Blue (Color Code) |

## üìñ Project Background  

This project was originally developed as part of my **MSc Data Science dissertation**.  
I am currently updating it to align with **modern MLOps and AI system design best practices**.  

üëâ Old code is available in the [old-main branch](https://github.com/gagansingh894/AutoRec-AI/tree/old-main).
